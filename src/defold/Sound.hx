        On Android you can only get a correct reading of this state if your game is not playing any sounds itself.
        This is a limitation in the Android SDK. If your game is playing any sounds, even with a gain of zero, this
        function will return `false`.

         * In the `init` function of your main collection script before any sounds are triggered
         * In a window listener callback when the window.WINDOW_EVENT_FOCUS_GAINED event is received

        Both those times will give you a correct reading of the state even when your application is
        swapped out and in while playing sounds and it works equally well on Android and iOS.
